today i wrote the longest post;only to lose it as i posted it.don&#8217;t feel motivated to write at all. i&#8217;ve been home al night. didn&#8217;t go to the bday party. dk bagged out ,so did dp. i am so tired but i &#8216;m having the hardest time sleeping.  
as isolated as i am these days, i am so into this time alone.it&#8217;s weird, though.to go from too many people calling and wanting to do stuff- to noone.-i feel a bit resentful when i think about the circumstances but then i get over it. i was only geting annoyed with most of the people in my life. mom is coming on friday. should be fun. please please don&#8217;t let us fight about money or anything of the ilk.i&#8217;m a little atressed about lack of income. but not too bad. i have such a crush on new boy. saw him this eve-on a random tv show. looked kinda gay on it, but still cute. i hope he is at the party at j&#8217;s on saturday night.i told j to invite him . we talked onthe phone at length this eve. (j and i) feels good to have him back in my life.   
mom will be happy to hangout with him. sat night will be fun.( regardless of new crush being there or not,)
