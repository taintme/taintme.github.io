old bf that hated me just emailed me back and was very kind and very honest about how much i had hurt her an dhow great, origanilly, our friendship had been.  
wow.  
AND..mom and i talked about my financial sit. (or lack thereof)She is being fearful, rightly so, i guess. because once again i am in need of $$.  
I can&#8217;t seem to do anything right right now. i am not bringing in any money and i have so much to pay out.  
i ahve some pretty hard desions to make. do i move out?  
where?to v?  
i would die.
