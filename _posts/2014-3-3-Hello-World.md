title: Taintme posting to jekyll via github
---

I have been writing shit online for 17 years. mostly nonesense and it has afforded me to gain skills about basic front end web developing- I started on blogger with their builtin hosting.. but as i got creative i was forced to learn css and javascripting.. and  2000 for flexiblity  moved my posting to a dreamhost shared server 
( they are a nghtmare but i still use for my dreamhost account for quickie sites and some basic hosting)
Then with wordpress i moved it all there- learning quite abit of php in the process of wanting customized theme and functions.

Through the years i have learned html css javascript  ajax jQuery   php xml mySql editing via phpMyadmin and basic server hosting system managmen and  command line terminal stuff.
Now ive migratied a vs of my writing over to github /jekyll for some more fun and learning .
