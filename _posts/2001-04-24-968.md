hil is back. yeah!  
can&#8217;t figure out what is wrong with me..perhaps lack of food coupled with isolation is dragging my system down.  
whatever. i&#8217;m feeling a bit inspired to make something of this site, now.  
i wonder what it is i am here to do, on this earth, i mean.  
feel as though if i stay in this state-i&#8217;ll never do a thing productive again. such an odd place to be.  
like being on adrug run- alot like that, actually &#8216;cept without the fun of the &#8216;high&#8217;  
i&#8217;d know, eh?  
god i can&#8217;t believe it has been soo long since i did drugs. i am at major cross road in my life.  
but ican&#8217;t see what the choices are.
