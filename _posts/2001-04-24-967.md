my life is getting so weird. i went to the lc this am, had breakfast w/michelle and her &#8216;gang&#8217; of friends.   
as i sat in the cabin , i thught abut being where i am . this place in my head . it&#8217;s definetly a differentt state of mind than any i have known.  
meaning i don&#8217;t care that i am not in contact with my old &#8216;group&#8217;. i am finding this nonattachment relieving and although i am lonely and bored at times -.  
it is giving me a perspective on who i trully am. and who i want to become.  
i think that i want to find my true right path in the world and work is the starting point. teaching myself these new programs is a step in the right direction, if only for my enjoyment at present.  
i guess the signs that those &#8216;others&#8217; -as i &#8216;ll now refer to my old group of friends-were not helping me were always there. i just chose to ignore them.it can be so much easier to hang out with assholes sometimes , if only because you don&#8217;t have to look at your own life due to judging everyone else.  
i guess i was just ready to start activating my destiny.
