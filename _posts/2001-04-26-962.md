ok, after having read samantha&#8217;s thought s on what a blog could/should/tries to do, ifeel like i need to follow her lead and have some sort of purpose or structure to what i aim to give/get from this here rambling series.  
let&#8217;s see..a mission statement will be my goal for myself today.   
that&#8217;s it. by the end of today i will have a personal purpose set in type and posted for me to see up here , of what i will be writing about for the next little while.  
some ideas..a journal about being &#8216;sober&#8217; in your twenties..nah , if anyone were to read this then i would be breaking anonimyty(sp?) all over the place.  
perhaps.. what i &#8216;ve learned thus far , in general, imean- i do have a lot of life experiences that are somewhat shocking..i know i could start to write my memories of travel/drugs etc.   
stupid. i&#8217;ll have to figure this out whilst working, then get back to myself on here ,later
