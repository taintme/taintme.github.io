last night, although exhausted beyond beyond, i had the nicest dinner w/ ss. she and s broke up and it seems like a really good thing. it was just one of those relationships that i thought(judgmental me) was &#8216;off&#8217;. they were both awesome. but he is so much older and she didn&#8217;t see how great she was. or something. anyway&#8230;  
.. after dinner at the restaurant. we went to g&#8217;s. it was dead when we got there. and i only wanted to go to see if the french boy was there. i stayed till it was packed beyond belief ( with all the tacky types,mostly) and went home at 12:30. no french boy-was going to get up and go to the cabin, but didn&#8217;t quite make it. nice morning though. coffee bean sunshine reading new blogs of random people. Actually, i started reading this one girl&#8217;s and it really freaked me out, as she sounded so much like me from years past..like when i was in the throws of it all with todd etc. it was so sad to read. she is doing all the bargaining shit i did. like if she lived somewhere else it would all be better..if she could just ignore the mean assholes around her, she&#8217;d be okay etc etc.  
yuck   
makes me sooo damn grateful for the life i have today.  
also, brent called and he is so fucked up. it&#8217;s knarly. he is always high when he calls and acts like he&#8217;s not. even at 10 am &#8211; he is high.
